This C++ performs the following functions in very efficient algorithm

1:Convert Base-10 number into Base-2 number
2:Counts the number of maximum consecutive one's in the number (Can be modified to count zero's)
3:Convert the Integer Number into String representation

Algorithm efficiency
Only one for loop and a while loop
